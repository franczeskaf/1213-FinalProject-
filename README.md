Hotel Reservation System

The Hotel Reservation System is a Java-based application designed to manage hotel room bookings, display available rooms, and calculate total costs. It includes different room types (Standard and Deluxe) and ensures data persistence through file handling. This project was developed collaboratively to enhance object-oriented programming skills and file operations.

# Project Overview #

This project is a Hotel Reservation System developed using Java to streamline hotel management operations. The system allows users to book rooms, check available rooms, and compute the total cost of occupied rooms. It also supports reading and writing room details from a file to maintain data consistency.

# Features #

Room Management: Tracks available and occupied rooms.

Booking System: Allows users to reserve rooms dynamically.

Cost Calculation: Computes the total cost of all occupied rooms.

File Persistence: Saves and loads room details using a text file.

Abstract Class Implementation: Utilizes an abstract Room class for extensibility.

# Technologies Used #

Java (Object-Oriented Programming)

File Handling (Java I/O for room persistence)

Data Structures (ArrayList for room storage)

# Project Structure #

Main.java – Handles user interaction and manages the system loop.

Room.java – Defines an abstract class for rooms.

DeluxeRoom.java – Implements a specific room type with a fixed cost.

StandardRoom.java – Implements another room type with a different cost.

HotelReservation.java – Manages room operations and file handling.

roomList.txt – Stores room data for persisten
